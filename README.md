Curator Java
===============================
A java implementation of curator like functionality for elasticsearch.

State
-------------------------------
Provide a convenient java way to manage elasticsearch indices.  Elasticsearch has all the builders
to do this, but they are kind of cumbersome to use.  So I want to implement the core operations of
index management and then move into implementing the automation around managing.  This will allow
someone to both use out of the box and also integrate with their own scheduling mechanism.

State
-------------------------------
Just getting started.  Almost no usable functionality other than some implementations of core operations.
